## fast-browse-PWA
This is a super useless project that uses JS and AJAX requests to request a webpage, manipulates it to prevent image autoloading (to load the page faster) and shows it to you.

This code is super buggy and was written just for fun.

To acually use it you need to install a chrome plugin that allows you CORS-Requests. I personally use this plugin: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi
